# LED_strip_driver
Arduino Mini Pro driving a LED strip. 

Runs from 12V 1A power supply. Uses a photoresistor to sense ambient light. At daytime LED strip is off, average current consumption is about 20 mA. At dusk Arduino switches relay on and runs LED patterns for about 4 hours. After that relay is off. 

PCP size 50x50mm. Relay is Millionspot H500S12. Arduino Mini Pro 5V 16 MHz. Photoresistor 1 MOhm. Enclosure - a 200 ml plastic storage container from www.sistemaplastic.com
